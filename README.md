Information is power. With every election cycle, politicians unleash their
different plots on the electorate in order to woo voters and win support,
casting themselves as the best products and their opponents as the worst. But
voting choices should be based on capacity and antecedents. In purchasing a
product, the consumer that does his/her due diligence usually makes the best
choices. Elections are no different.

## apology statement

As an intro, I did not follow any code architecture in creating this site, so I
appologize for all your trouble as you read through this code. When you read
through this, you might get an headache or get an annoyance because of asking
yourself why did he (the person writting this to you) do things this way.

## Ongoing

As I procede forward code refactory will be done, because I know if I leave this
code base and come back to it, like you I might get a little annoyed with myself
for this.
